  [#824](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/824)

## 1.0.0

**Release date:** 2025-09-15

This is the first GA release of the image-reflector-controller. It comes with
various bug fixes and improvements.

⚠️ The `v1beta1` APIs were removed. Before upgrading the CRDs, Flux users must run [`flux migrate`](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/pull/5473) to migrate the cluster storage off `v1beta1`. After the upgrade, all manifests in Git which contain `ImagePolicy`, `ImageRepository` and `ImageUpdateAutomation` definitions must be updated to:

```yaml
apiVersion: image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
```

### ImageRepository

The `ImageRepository` API has been promoted to `v1` (GA) status. The `v1` API is backwards compatible with `v1beta2`.

### ImagePolicy

The `ImagePolicy` API has been promoted to `v1` (GA) status. The `v1` API is backwards compatible with `v1beta2`.

The `ImagePolicy` now supports the `.spec.suspend` field and includes `.status.lastHandledReconcileAt` for better reconciliation tracking. Deprecated status fields have been removed from the ImagePolicy status to clean up the API surface.

### General updates

The controller now supports system certificate pools for improved CA compatibility, and TLS ServerName pinning has been removed from TLS configuration for better flexibility. A `--default-service-account=<sa name>` flag was introduced for workload identity multi-tenancy lockdown. The auto-login flags for cloud providers have been removed; users should now specify the `.spec.provider` field in `ImageRepository` resources for contextual authentication.

In addition, the Kubernetes dependencies have been updated to v1.34, BadgerDB has been updated to v4.8
and various other controller dependencies have been updated to their latest
version. The controller is now built with Go 1.25.

[public ECR repositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/integrations/aws/#for-amazon-public-elastic-container-registry).

Fixes:
- Fix authentication for public ECR
  [#782](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/782)

## 0.35.1

**Release date:** 2025-06-01

This prerelease fixes the ImagePolicy reconciler spamming red-herring
error messages.

Fixes:
- Fix ImagePolicy reconciler getting triggered when ImageRepository is not ready
  [#774](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/774)
- Fix ImagePolicy reconciler spamming `no tags in database` after a restart
  [#776](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/776)

## 0.35.0

**Release date:** 2025-05-27

This prerelease comes with support for object-level workload identity
and image digest reflection.

### ImageRepository

ImageRepository API now supports object-level workload identity by setting
`.spec.provider` to one of `aws`, `azure`, or `gcp`, and setting
`.spec.serviceAccountName` to the name of a service account in the same
namespace that has been configured with appropriate cloud permissions.
For this feature to work, the controller feature gate
`ObjectLevelWorkloadIdentity` must be enabled. See a complete guide
[here](https://fluxcd.io/flux/integrations/).

ImageRepository API now caches registry credentials for cloud providers
by default. This behavior can be disabled or fine-tuned by adjusting the
token cache controller flags (see
[docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/image/options/#image-reflector-flags)).
The token cache also exposes metrics that are documented
[here](https://fluxcd.io/flux/monitoring/metrics/#controller-metrics).

### ImagePolicy

ImagePolicy API now supports configuring a digest reflection policy
through the field `.spec.digestReflectionPolicy`. This allows users
to configure the controller to reflect the digest of the latest image
tag in the status of the ImagePolicy resource. See this
[guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/image-update/#digest-pinning)
for more details.

### General updates

The controller now collects the garbage from BadgerDB, the database
where it stores image tags. The interval is 10 minutes by default,
but it can be disabled or fine-tuned, see
[docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/image/options/#image-reflector-flags).

In addition, the Kubernetes dependencies have been updated to v1.33
and various other controller dependencies have been updated to their latest
version. The controller is now built with Go 1.24.

Fixes:
- Downgrade `Masterminds/semver` to v3.3.0
  [#761](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/761)

Improvements:
- [RFC-0010] Introduce object-level workload identity and cache credentials

## 0.27.0

**Release date:** 2023-03-31

This prerelease adds support for Azure Workload Identity when using
`provider: azure` in `ImageRepository` objects.

In addition, the controller now supports horizontal scaling
using sharding based on a label selector.

The new `--watch-label-selector` lets operators provide a label to the controller manager
which in turn uses it to reconcile only those resources
(`ImageRepositories` and `ImagePolicies`) that match the given label expression.

This way operators can deploy multiple instances of IRC,
each reconciling a distinct set of resources based on their labels
and effectively scale the controller horizontally.

If sharding is enabled, all `ImagePolicy` resources can only refer
to those `ImageRepository` resources that are captured by the exact
same label selector as the `ImagePolicies`.

Improvements:
- Add reconciler sharding capability based on label selector
  [#365](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/365)
- Enable Workload Identity for Azure
  [#363](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/363)
- Move `controllers` to `internal/controllers`
  [#362](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/362)

## 0.26.1

**Release date:** 2023-03-20

This prerelease fixes a bug in the reconcilers due to which an error log due to
some failure may contain previous successful reconciliation message.

Fixes:
- Fix error logs with stale success message
  [#357](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/357)

Improvements:
- chore: migrate from k8s.gcr.io to registry.k8s.io
  [#358](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/358)

## 0.26.0

**Release date:** 2023-03-08

This prerelease re-instantiates the `--aws-autologin-for-ecr`,
`--gcp-autologin-for-gcr` and `--azure-autologin-for-acr` flags which became
deprecated in [`v0.25.0`](#0250), after receiving feedback of it complicating
upgrading gradually. The flags will now be removed in the future, and at least
one minor version after this release. We are sorry for any inconvenience this
may have caused.

In addition, `klog` is now configured to log using the same logger as the rest
of the controller (providing a consistent log format).

Lastly, the controller is now built with Go 1.20, and the dependencies have
been updated to their latest versions.

Improvements:
- Update Go to 1.20
  [#347](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/347)
- Update dependencies
  [#349](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/349)
  [#351](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/351)
- Use `logger.SetLogger` to also configure `klog`
  [#350](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/350)
- Fallback to autologin flags if no provider is specified
  [#353](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/353)


## 0.25.0

**Release date:** 2023-02-16

This prerelease graduates the `ImageRepository` and `ImagePolicy` APIs to
v1beta2.

### `image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2`

After upgrading the controller to v0.25.0, please update the `ImageRepository`
and `ImagePolicy` **Custom Resources** in Git by replacing
`image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1` with `image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2` in all
YAML manifests.

### Highlights

#### New API specification format

[The specifications for the `v1beta2`
API](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/tree/v0.25.0/docs/spec/v1beta2)
have been written in a new format with the aim to be more valuable to a user.
Featuring separate sections with examples, and information on how to write
and work with them.

#### Enhanced Kubernetes Conditions

`ImageRepository` and `ImagePolicy` resources will now advertise more explicit
Condition types, provide `Reconciling` and `Stalled` Conditions where applicable
for [better integration with
`kstatus`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md#conditions),
and record the Observed Generation on the Condition.

#### Enhanced ImageRepository scanned tags status

The `ImageRepository` objects will now show the ten latest scanned tags, which
can be helpful in troubleshooting to see a sample of the tags that have been
scanned.

```yaml
status:
  ...
  lastScanResult:
    latestTags:
    - latest
    - 6.3.3
    - 6.3.2
    - 6.3.1
    - 6.3.0
    - 6.2.3
    - 6.2.2
    - 6.2.1
    - 6.2.0
    - 6.1.8
    scanTime: "2023-02-07T19:18:01Z"
    tagCount: 41
```

#### Enhanced ImagePolicy update status

The `ImagePolicy` objects will now keep a record of the previous image in the
status and include it in the update message in the events and notifications.

Status:
```yaml
status:
  ...
  latestImage: ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.2.1
  observedPreviousImage: ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.2.0
```

Event/notification message:

```
Latest image tag for 'ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo' updated from 6.2.0 to 6.2.1
```

#### :warning: Breaking changes

The autologin flags (`--aws-autologin-for-ecr`, `--gcp-autologin-for-gcr` and
`--azure-autologin-for-acr`) have been deprecated to bring the Image API closer
to the Source API, where cloud provider contextual login is configured at object
level with `.spec.provider`. Usage of these flags will result in a logged error.
Please update all the `ImageRepository` manifests that require contextual login
with the new field `.spec.provider` and the appropriate cloud provider value;
`aws`, `gcp`, or `azure`. Refer the
[docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/image/imagerepositories/#provider) for
more details and examples.

## 0.22.0

**Release date:** 2022-09-27

This prerelease comes with strict validation rules for API fields which define a
(time) duration. Effectively, this means values without a time unit (e.g. `ms`,
`s`, `m`, `h`) will now be rejected by the API server. To stimulate sane
configurations, the units `ns`, `us` and `µs` can no longer be configured, nor
can `h` be set for fields defining a timeout value.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated
to Kubernetes controller-runtime v0.13.

:warning: **Breaking changes:**
- `ImageRepository.spec.interval` new validation pattern is `"^([0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?(ms|s|m|h))+$"`

**Release date:** 2022-07-26

This prerelease comes with fix for a bug introduced in the last release during
the refactoring of the cloud provider registry auto-login. When a cloud provider
registry is identified, but is not configured for auto-login, to continue
attempting scan as public repository, an unconfigured provider error is ignored.

Fixes:
- imagerepo: Continue scan for unconfigured provider
  [#290](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/290)

Improvements:
- Fix the indentation issues in example
  [#286](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/286)

## 0.19.0

**Release date:** 2022-05-27

This prerelease adds support for excluding certain tags when defining `ImageRepositories`.
The `spec.exclusionList` field can be used to specify a list of regex expressions.
If the exclusion list is empty, by default the regex `"^.*\\.sig$"` is used
to exclude all tags ending with `.sig`, since these are
[cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) OCI artifacts and not container
images which can be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.

Features:
- Add `exclusionList` to ImageRepository API
  [#256](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/256)

  [#243](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/243)

## 0.17.1

**Release date:** 2022-03-23

This prerelease ensures the API objects fully adhere to newly introduced
interfaces, allowing them to work in combination with e.g. the
[`conditions`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fluxcd/pkg/runtime@v0.13.2/conditions)
package.

Improvements:

  [#241](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/241)

## 0.17.0

**Release date:** 2022-03-21

This prerelease updates various dependencies to their latest versions, thereby
eliminating at least 13 OSVs, and preparing the code base for more standardized
controller runtime operations.

In addition, the Azure Scope has been fixed to work correctly with Azure
Environment Credentials.

Improvements:
- Refactor logging to be more consistent
  [#232](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/232)
- Update dependencies
  [#234](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/234)

## 0.16.0

**Release date:** 2022-01-31

This prerelease comes with support for automatically getting
credentials from Azure and Google Cloud when scanning images in ACR and GCR.
To configure autologin for ACR, ECR or GCR please see the
[cloud providers authentication guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/image-update/#imagerepository-cloud-providers-authentication).

Platform admins can disable cross-namespace references with the
`--no-cross-namespace-refs=true` flag. When this flag is set,
image policies can only refer to image repositories in the same namespace
as the policy object, preventing tenants from accessing another tenant's repositories.

Starting with this version, the controller deployment conforms to the
Kubernetes [restricted pod security standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted):
- all Linux capabilities were dropped
- the root filesystem was set to read-only
- the seccomp profile was set to the runtime default
- run as non-root was enabled
- the user and group ID was set to 65534

**Breaking changes**:
- The use of new seccomp API requires Kubernetes 1.19.
- The controller container is now executed under 65534:65534 (userid:groupid).
  This change may break deployments that hard-coded the user ID of 'controller' in their PodSecurityPolicy.

Features:
- Get credentials from GCP/Azure when needed
  [#194](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/194)
- Allow disabling cross-namespace references to image repositories
  [#228](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/228)

Improvements:
- Publish SBOM and sign release artifacts
  [#227](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/227)
- Drop capabilities, enable seccomp and enforce runAsNonRoot
  [#223](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/223)
- Refactor Fuzz implementation
  [#221](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/221)
- Clarifications for auto-login feature
  [#219](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/219)

Fixes:
- Fix scheme validation check when using host:port
  [#222](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/222)
- Fix makefile envtest and controller-gen usage
  [#218](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/218)

## 0.15.0

**Release date:** 2022-01-07

  [#190](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/190)
- Add various instructions on development documentation
  [#215](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/215)

## 0.14.0

**Release date:** 2021-11-23

This prerelease updates Alpine to v3.14, and several dependencies to their latest
version. Solving an issue with `rest_client_request_latency_seconds_.*` high
cardinality metrics.

To enhance the experience of consumers observing the `ImagePolicy` and `ImageRepository`
objects using `kstatus`, a default of `-1` is now configured for the `observedGeneration`
to ensure it does not report a false positive in the time the controller has not marked
the resource with a `Ready` condition yet.

Improvements:
- Set default observedGeneration to -1
  [#189](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/189)
- Update Alpine to v3.14
  [#203](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/203)

* Get credentials from AWS ECR when needed
  [#174](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/174)

## 0.12.0

**Release date:** 2021-10-08

This prerelease comes with an (experimental) introduction of ACLs for allowing cross-namespace
access to `ImageRepository` resources. You can read more about how they work in the
[pull request](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/162) that
introduced them.

In addition, a bug has been fixed that caused the controller to segfault when a malformed
SemVer was defined.

Improvements:
* [RFC] Add ACL support for allowing cross-namespace access to image repository
  [#162](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/162)

Fixes:
* policy: Handle failure due to invalid semver range

dependencies to align them with the Kubernetes `v1.21.3` release, including an update
of Badger to `v3.2103.1`.

Improvements:
* Update dependencies
  [#160](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/160)

## 0.11.0

**Release date:** 2021-06-28

This prerelease promotes the API version from `v1alpha2` to `v1beta1`.

:warning: With regard to the API version, no action is necessary at
present, as Kubernetes will automatically convert between `v1alpha2`
and `v1beta1` APIs.

You may wish to migrate `v1alpha2` YAML files to `v1beta1`, in
preparation for `v1alpha2` being deprecated (eventually; there is no
date set at the time of writing). This is simply a case of setting the
`apiVersion` field value:

    `apiVersion: image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1`

Improvements:
* Let people set the number of controller workers with a flag
  [#153](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/153)

## 0.10.0

**Release date:** 2021-06-10

This prerelease comes with an update to the Kubernetes and controller-runtime
dependencies to align them with the Kubernetes 1.21 release, including an update
of Badger to `v3.2103.0`.

Improvements:
* Better error reporting for image policy evaluation
  [#144](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/144)
* Update Go and Badger
  [#149](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/149)

* Remove v1alpha1 API from Scheme
  [#136](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/136)

## 0.9.0

**Release date:** 2021-04-21

This prerelease comes with breaking changes to the `image.toolkit.fluxcd.io` APIs.

The `v1alpha1` APIs have been promoted to `v1alpha2`, while the version has
changed the API definitions have not, and upgrading can be done by changing
the version in your manifests for the `ImageRepository` and `ImagePolicy` kinds.

Improvements:
* Move API v1alpha1 to v1alpha2
  [#132](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/132)
* Add API docs for v1alpha2
  [#134](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/134)

Fixes:
* Parse docker auths and use only hostname
  [#119](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/119)
  
## 0.8.0

**Release date:** 2021-04-06

This prerelease comes with a breaking change to the leader election ID
from `e189b2df.fluxcd.io` to `image-reflector-controller-leader-election`
to be more descriptive. This change should not have an impact on most
installations, as the default replica count is `1`. If you are running
a setup with multiple replicas, it is however advised to scale down
before upgrading.

The controller exposes a gauge metric to track the suspended status
of `ImageRepository` objects: `gotk_suspend_status{kind,name,namespace}`.

Improvements:
* Set leader election deadline to 30s
  [#125](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/125)
* Record suspension metrics

This prerelease comes with two new argument flags,
introduced to support configuring the QPS
(`--kube-api-qps`) and burst (`--kube-api-burst`) while communicating
with the Kubernetes API server.

The `LocalObjectReference` from the Kubernetes core has been replaced
with our own, making the `name` a required field. The impact of this
should be limited to direct API consumers only, as the field was
already required by controller logic.

## 0.3.0

**Release date:** 2021-01-16

This prerelease comes with updates to Kubernetes and Badger dependencies.
The Kubernetes packages were updated to v1.20.2 and Badger to v3.2011.0.

## 0.2.0

**Release date:** 2021-01-13

This is the second MINOR prerelease, adding support for [selecting
images using regular expressions][regex].

Other notable changes:

- `controller-runtime` dependency has been upgraded to `v0.7.0`.
- The container image for ARMv7 and ARM64 that used to be published
  separately as `image-reflector-controller:*-arm64` has been merged
  with the AMD64 image.

## 0.1.0

**Release date:** 2020-12-10

This is the first prerelease of image-reflector-controller and its
API. The purpose of the controller is to scan image repositories, and
calculate a "latest image" according to some specification. Automation
(e.g., the [image-automation-controller][auto-controller]) can use
that information to run updates, so that the latest image is deployed.

The controller and API conform to the conventions of the GitOps
Toolkit, so will be compatible with (and soon, included in) the `flux`
CLI and dashboards and so on.

This release supports:

 - supplying a docker-registry secret as credentials for accessing an
   image repository
 - selecting images according to a [semver][semver] range.
 - selecting images according to alphabetical order (ascending or
   descending)
 - keeping the database on a volume (e.g., a PersistentVolumeClaim) so
   that it survives restarts
